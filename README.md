# COVID-19-CURRENT-CASES
In this, we extract the current details about covid - 19 cases of each country<BR>
The COVID-19 pandemic is a pandemic of corona virus by which lakhs of people are died or suffered .<BR>
From this,you get to know about current no. of cases and recoveries and death of each country.<BR>

For this,Firtly you have to install a library i.e. covid<BR>
By simpling typing "pip install covid" in your command prompt<BR>

In this,I used following function:<BR>
1- list_countries()                : Used to extract countries. Its falls under covid library <BR>
2- get_status_by_country_name()    : Used to extract the details of a county. It is also falls under covid library<BR>
3- melt()                          : Used to unpivot rows<BR>

In this, I plot two graphs and also used buttons:<BR>
1- Choropleth map <BR>
2- Tree map<BR>
If you are run this progrom in your PC thn it takes 3-4 min to ectracting the data.<BR>
